aboutTitle: "Why Radical Product Thinking?"
aboutCopy: "Iteration rules product development, but it isn’t enough to produce dramatic results. Too many good products
become bloated, fragmented, directionless, and driven by irrelevant metrics. Radical Product Thinking helps you avoid
these
“product diseases” by giving you clarity around your vision and strategy, which drives prioritization, and execution."

You can get the free toolkit, read about the RPT approach in the book, and book trainings."

You need to use the few pivots you have carefully and deliberately. RPT helps you translate your vision into action very methodically so you iterate less and achieve more. RPT is being used around the world by a wide range of organizations including startups, multinationals, and government agencies. You can learn more about RPT from the blog, book trainings and read the Radical Product Thinking book."

They’re able to take ownership of the product vision and develop a comprehensive and actionable product strategy. Most importantly, they communicate their rationale for prioritization and decision-making so that they can spread their influence across the organization without having to attend every meeting. These skills are often hard to learn on the job because of the everyday focus on tactical execution. But you can level up your product team to take on a more strategic role by booking a Radical Product Thinking training."
