- question: Why should I choose the RPT Methodology?
  answer: "Radical Product Thinking (RPT) helps you build successful products systematically. When you innovate, you have 2-3 pivots before you run out of either money or momentum. 
  You need to use the few pivots you have carefully and deliberately. RPT helps you translate your vision into action very methodically so you iterate less and achieve more. 
  RPT is being used by organizations around the world by a wide range of organizations including startups, multinationals, and government agencies. 
  You can learn more about RPT from the [blog](/blog), book [trainings](/trainings) and read the [Radical Product Thinking book.](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Product-Thinking-Mindset-Innovating/dp/1523093315)"

- question: What training is needed for a product manager?
  answer: "The best product managers have skills beyond A/B testing and optimizing for metrics. They're able to take ownership of the product vision and develop a comprehensive and actionable product strategy. 
  Most importantly, they communicate their rationale for prioritization and decision-making so that they can spread their influence across the organization without having to attend every meeting. 
  These skills are often hard to learn on the job because of the everyday focus on tactical execution. But you can level up your product team to take on a more strategic role by booking a [Radical Product Thinking training](/trainings)."
