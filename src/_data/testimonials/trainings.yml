  testimonial: After 18 months, my team still raves about our Radical Product Thinking workshop. Radhika is one of the very few individuals that has had a long lasting impact on Whispli and the way we now build our product. It all came down to her approach, knowledge and the fact that she is down to earth, and has done it before!

  testimonial: This training program is a must for product managers and leaders who want to create great products. It helped me simplify the process of creating vision, strategy, roadmap, and execution plans and provided specific ways to link these activities into an integrated plan.
