One of the hardest challenges for leaders is to find the right balance between giving teams direction to shape your outcomes versus giving employees autonomy. In my career spanning over 20 years, I’ve only come across a handful of leaders who have found the right balance. Most likely, you’ve had similar experiences where leaders are either too hands-off or micromanage teams and as you rise to a leadership position, you wonder how you can strike the right balance.  

Early in my career, I was fortunate to have experienced how rewarding work feels when I worked in Avid’s broadcast division led by David Schleifer. David had found the right balance between control and autonomy and his approach led to better business outcomes.  

I remember a day at work where David called me over to his office. A customer in Europe was ready to throw out our equipment and had escalated their complaint to him. On that call, David just introduced me to the customer and the sales rep saying that I would be in charge of addressing their issue - he didn’t start to solve the problem.  

I worked with the customer and the sales rep to understand the situation, make them feel heard, and add a feature in our product to address their issue (which coincidentally would also help other customers). In the span of a month the customer relationship turned around and they bought more equipment. All of this was done over the phone so they had no idea what my role was in the organization or my title. When I eventually met the sales rep in person, he was taken aback. He realized that I was only in my mid 20's and his first words to me reflected his shock, "I thought you'd be more senior."  

In the broadcast team we had a clear collective vision and each person on the team had the autonomy to contribute towards the collective goal regardless of age or seniority. Schleifer shares, “Managing people is about letting them work to their potential. As a team, we were always at our best when we were the sum of all of our contributions.” Indeed, each of us on the broadcast team played a role that was well beyond our titles and the results were visible. While Avid was a newcomer to the broadcast market at that time, in the span of five years we had won almost every major broadcaster around the globe.  

In the last decade, micromanagement has been glorified. Elon Musk even famously declared in an interview with the WSJ that he was a “nano manager”. It turns out, however, that micromanagement is hazardous for employee health. Research shows that even when a job was stressful, giving employees more autonomy over how they did their job increased employee well-being and reduced mortality rates.  

Empowering employees is also good for business. Research shows that companies that offer autonomy are 10 times more likely to outperform traditional organizations in the short term and more than 20 times more likely to outperform them in the long term.  

While the benefits are clear, it’s not always easy to find the right balance between giving employees autonomy and controlling the direction. Here are three things you can do to achieve the right balance:  
<br>
### 1. Give employees clarity on the direction
   When the vision is unclear, it’s hard for employees to take initiative. A broad vision statement such as “To be the leader in XYZ” or “Reinventing ABC” doesn’t give clear direction on what problem you’re setting out to solve together or the end-state you envision. It’s easier for employees to take initiative when you have a shared picture of what the world looks like when you can say “mission accomplished.” I’ve found that it’s hard to write such a vision statement when starting with a blank sheet of paper. Instead, you can download the free Radical Product Thinking Toolkit to craft a detailed vision.

### 2. Share your rationale for decision-making so others can make decisions as you would
   It's easier to be empowered when employees know how their managers think and understand their rationale. Employees across the company are constantly making trade-offs between the long term and the short term through their own work. A software developer could choose to spend time carefully building so ware for the long term or could write code quickly to deliver something in the short term and undertake major repairs later.  

   Instead of dictating the right tradeoffs, you scale as a leader when you spread your thinking across the organization by developing in others the same intuition you have for decision-making. The Radical Product Thinking rubric for prioritization helps you visualize these tradeoffs on two axes: Vision vs. Survival.  

   Decisions that are good for your long-term vision and for survival are in the Ideal quadrant - these are the easy decisions. The harder ones are Investing in the vision (where it’s good for the long-term but not for the short term) or Building Vision Debt (where you’re taking a detour from your vision in exchange for short-term gains). The Danger quadrant represents decisions that are bad for both the vision and survival (also easy decisions).  

   When you make decisions as a team, talk about where the opportunity lies in these quadrants. When you use this approach to share your rationale for decision-making, you won’t need to micromanage because you’ll be influencing others to make decisions like you would, even when you’re not around.

### 3. Give employees the mental and emotional bandwidth to think strategically and make decisions

When employees don’t have enough thinking time or are feeling burned out, they don’t take initiative or look for empowerment. Instead, they stay in the execution and tactical realm which requires managers to provide direction on even minor decisions.  

Micromanagement creates a vicious cycle: employees feel disengaged and burned out when being micromanaged, so they don’t take initiative, which in turn reinforces the manager’s belief that micromanagement is the only way to get the team to deliver on their goals.  

You can break through this cycle by using the Radical Product Thinking Culture Rubric to engineer a culture where your team can do their best work together. By way of summary, the rubric helps you understand your work culture on two dimensions: whether work is fulfilling or not and whether it’s urgent or not. You can analyze your culture using this rubric by evaluating how much of the workday employees spend in each of these quadrants: Meaningful Work, Heroism, Operational Cactus, and Soul-Sucking. The Radical Product Thinking approach to culture helps you maximize the Meaningful Work quadrant and minimize the three danger quadrants.

Every employee in your team is helping you change the world. By empowering employees, you’re giving each person the opportunity to contribute to your collective vision by playing a role that goes beyond their title or job function.
