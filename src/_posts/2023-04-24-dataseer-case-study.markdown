If you’re a leader who is managing a pivot and want to align your team in a new direction, or if you have a team that’s new and you want them to gel, this case study gives you the example of how a company, DataSeer, used Radical Product Thinking to manage this successfully.  

<br>

## Background

[DataSeer](https://www.dataseer.digital/) is an AI company that provides automated visualization software to digitize unstructured data trapped in 2D images and creates a digital twin database with API access. In 2021 when the board appointed Jo-Anne Ting as the CEO, the company had just pivoted and most of the team members were new to the company. The team was also completely remote and most people hadn't met each other in person.  

Ting wanted to bring the team together for an offsite to kick off 2022 and align on the
problem they were setting out to solve together, and create an actionable plan for the year. So she asked me to facilitate a day-long Racial Product Thinking workshop. She also wanted the kickoff to be a bonding experience for the team and reinforce a culture of collaboration. To achieve the above, we planned an agenda with a set of group exercises to craft a vision, strategy, and derive hypotheses and metrics to measure success.  


<br>

## Vision workshop

The morning agenda included icebreakers and a group visioning session. The RPT approach to a [vision statement]({% post_url 2020-07-11-vision-doesnt-have-to-be-hairy%}) challenges conventional thinking – it’s not a broad and unchanging statement. Instead it’s a Mad Libs statement that details the answers to the who, what, why, when, and how questions:  
- Who: Whose world are we setting out to change?
- What: What is their problem today and how are they solving it?
- Why: Why is the status quo unacceptable?
- When: When can we say “mission accomplished”?
- How: How will we bring about this world?


Team members across different functions including engineering, sales, and customer support, shared diverse perspectives that were thought-provoking as the team considered what problem they were setting out to solve. Their answers also helped air out misalignments so the team could consider these different perspectives and then agree on a shared vision. Most importantly, as each team member contributed to a shared vision, it also helped everyone internalize the vision and make it their own.  

Using RPT’s fill-in-the-blanks approach we crafted a Radical Vision Statement for DataSeer that describes the problem statement, why the status quo is unacceptable, and the world envisioned by the team:  

**Today when** [_junior engineers_]**, want to** [_modify a design or build a data model for a simulation with an accurate data representation_]**, they have to** [_digitize manually by painfully interpreting each symbol and text and the result has to be verified by a senior engineer which requires some back and forth_]**. This is unacceptable because** [_it’s soul-crushingly tedious work that people with advanced degrees have to do instead of spending time on solving interesting engineering problems – it’s easy to burnout or feel disengaged when work feels less meaningful_]**. We envision a world where** [_engineers get time back so engineering projects can move forward faster and at a lower cost and organizations can take on more projects because they have more confidence in accurate digitization_]**. We are bringing this world about through** [_machine learning that automates manual digitization by predicting symbols and text_]**.**  

Without the RPT approach, I’ve often heard complaints about visioning exercises that feel like an unending game of vision bingo. Instead, a facilitated visioning session for DataSeer to craft this detailed vision took only an hour and a half and was so productive that a team member enthusiastically remarked, “We should have done this exercise when we first started the company!”  

<br>

## Strategy workshop including Hypotheses, and Metrics

Armed with a clear vision, the agenda for the afternoon was to develop a strategy, hypotheses, and metrics to measure success. In the RPT way, we crafted a comprehensive [RDCL Strategy]({% post_url 2022-03-21-three-characteristics-of-good-product-Strategy%}) to translate the vision into a set of actionable steps. We started by identifying the personas who would interact with the product. Next we identified each of the elements of the mnemonic RDCL, i.e. the [Real pain points]({% post_url 2021-04-15-real-pain-points%}) that each of the personas face, the Design or functionality that would solve those pain points, the underlying Capabilities needed, and finally the Logistics including which sales channels would reach the target customers, and how the company would train and support users.  

Once we had crafted a detailed strategy, we could [derive metrics to measure progress]({% post_url 2021-04-29-the-downsides-of-OKRs%}) on the strategy. To take this hypothesis-driven approach, the team identified key elements of the strategy that needed to be tested. We then wrote hypotheses for each of those elements, treating each as an experiment the team would run. Finally, we identified the metrics that would validate each hypothesis and indicate whether that element of strategy is working.  

Identifying a clear strategy, followed by deriving hypotheses and metrics from the strategy helped align the team on an actionable plan and how the team would measure success.

## Results

The success of the workshops has led to a shift in how DataSeer approaches their yearly kickoff and [strategic planning]({% post_url 2021-09-14-stressfree-guide-to-Strategic-planning%}). They now view the vision and strategy workshops as an essential part of the process and a way to keep the team aligned and reinforce the company’s culture of continuous learning and hypothesis-driven execution.   

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous learning
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
An important aspect of DataSeer’s culture and Ting’s leadership style was the <a href="/blog/okrs-criticism">blame-free approach</a> of asking regularly, “What did we learn from this?” The RPT mindset of hypothesis-driven execution and measurement reinforced this approach. During the second workshop in January 2023, we revisited the hypotheses from the previous year and the metrics measured. We used the learnings to refine and update the strategy and identify new hypotheses to test in the coming year.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypothesis-driven product development  

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
One of the outcomes of these workshops has been a transformation in DataSeer’s product development. The company changed its approach of only releasing minimum viable product (MVP) features in the first year and then making one big upgrade a year later. Jo-Anne Ting says of the change, “Driven by a set of clear hypotheses and metrics derived from a vision and strategy, DataSeer is now iterating quickly on successive releases with improved feature functionality, incorporating user feedback, and making small adjustments each sprint cycle. This has allowed the company to improve the product more rapidly to service customers and find product-market fit.”

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower attrition
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
The workshop was also a bonding experience for the team and the team had no attrition in the year after the workshop. Jo-Anne Ting describes the effect on the team saying, “The workshop was an open, collaborative environment that encouraged everyone to participate and contribute to the conversation, regardless of their role or seniority in the company. The team members felt heard, and there was a sense of shared ownership of the product strategy that emerged from the workshop.  

<br> 
<br> 

The workshop was also an opportunity for the fully remote team to get to know each other better. We had scheduled time for casual conversations and icebreakers, which helped to break down barriers and facilitate bonding between team members. It helped people from each function see things from different perspectives. For example, it helped engineers see the sales and marketing perspective on the problem statement, and it helped to have sales folks asking about product and engineering deployment. It was an opportunity for people to cross outside the functional boundaries of their jobs, be curious, and ask even the simplest questions.”

I was thrilled that the vision and strategy workshops at DataSeer’s offsite supported Jo-Anne in her immensely insightful and thoughtful leadership.
